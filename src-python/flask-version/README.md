# Flask-Server version
This is the same thing except instead of using a Node server to run the API it's using a flask server which like seems to be working better than the Node server.

## Running
Make sure you're like in the directory, open the index.html.
To run the server,
```sh
py planet_lib.py
```
It will return that it is running in your_ip:5000 or something. Then you can calculate the time and stuff in the index.html. Also clock.html was just a test to see if we could use canvas to make clocks for each planet.
